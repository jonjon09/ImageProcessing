This was my final project for CSCE240. I worked with three other classmates on this. It offers four choices for image effects: Median Filtering, Image Blending, Contrast Enhancement, and Edge Detection. You must compile the code using 'make' and then run the code using "./prog" which will bring up further instructions. 
Once the code is running, it will ask you to choose which editing tool you would like to use as well as which pgm image file to use.
